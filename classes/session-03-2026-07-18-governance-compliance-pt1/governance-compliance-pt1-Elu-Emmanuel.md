## Lab / Hands-On Work

<!-- Describe what you did in the lab. Include steps, commands, or screenshots descriptions -->

### What I did

-

### What happened / Result

## My Takeaways

<!-- What was most valuable to you personally from this session? -->

- Existing resources was not affected after enforcing the policy but when altered or updated the policy takes effect
- Governance of azure resources using policy and resource locks help the security administrator manage and prevent deployment of noncompliant resources and prevent accidental deletion of resource.
